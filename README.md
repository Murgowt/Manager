A Hotel Business Manager

Hence the executions of business tasks should be handled in an efficient manner for a 
successful business. Hence we have come up with an efficient algorithm using BINARY 
SEARCH TREES, Sorting, and Linked lists and priority queues to make the work easy. In the 
code we deal with many things i.e.
1.item inventory 
2.employee database
3.order management
4.sales record. 
The very first thing the  program deals with is the item inventory in which there are 3 sub titles they are
1.1 add an item to the menu in which  name and the price of the item are stored
1.2 display the items in the menu 
1.3 delete an item from the menu if a particular items stock is completed we can delete the particular 
item from the menu and an other option exit is available to get to the main function.

The second one is the Employee database and it has 
2.1.appoint a new staff member in which the name of the employee and the salary given to him is to be stored 
2.2. Display the current staff which displays the total number of employees
2.3.fire a staff member from the database  

Third one is the order management in which it has 

3.1.add a new order in which name of the person who is taking the order and the date when the order to be 
delivered is stored 
3.2. display the pending orders which it displays the order of the person and when it is to be done including the date of the order and are displayed in an order the order which is first is displayed first and the order which is last is displayed last 
3.3. Remove the upcoming order.
